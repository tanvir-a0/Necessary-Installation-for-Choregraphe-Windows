# Necessary Installation for Choregraphe on Windows
<br>
This directory contains all the required files (or at least the ones I installed) during the setup of Choregraphe and while running the NAO robot on 19 January 2026.
<br>
The NAO robot runs correctly overall. However, there is a known issue: the “Run” button in Choregraphe works as expected, but the “Stop” button does not function properly.
<br>
<br>
Note: Install vcredist_x86.exe first then install vcredist_x64.exe second. Same for other files too (I did in this way).
